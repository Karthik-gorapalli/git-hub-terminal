Developed a predictive model to determine whether an individual is affected by PCOS (Polycystic Ovary Syndrome) based on a given dataset. Utilized Python and implemented Logistic Regression as the machine learning algorithm. Leveraged libraries such as Pandas for data preprocessing, Seaborn and Matplotlib for data visualization, and Scikit-learn for model building and evaluation. The project was executed in Jupyter Notebook, focusing on feature selection, model accuracy, and interpretability to provide meaningful insights into the dataset.
