Developed a predictive model to determine whether an individual is affected by PCOS (Polycystic Ovary Syndrome) based on a given dataset. Utilized Python and implemented Logistic Regression as the machine learning algorithm. Leveraged libraries such as Pandas for data preprocessing, Seaborn and Matplotlib for data visualization, and Scikit-learn for model building and evaluation. The project was executed in Jupyter Notebook, focusing on feature selection, model accuracy, and interpretability to provide meaningful insights into the dataset.

üìÅ Project Description: PCOS Prediction Using Logistic Regression
This repository contains the code and documentation for the PCOS Prediction Project, developed as part of an academic research study during my M.Sc. in Statistics at Andhra University. The main goal of this project is to predict whether a woman has Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) using clinical and diagnostic features.

üîç Key Features:
Logistic Regression model built in Python using scikit-learn

Data preprocessing and visualization using Pandas, Seaborn, and Matplotlib

Feature analysis to understand influential variables

Chi-square test (done in SPSS) to identify the most affected age group

Model evaluation using accuracy, confusion matrix, and ROC curve

üß™ Dataset:
The dataset was sourced from Kaggle. 

Includes clinical, hormonal, and demographic features of women
